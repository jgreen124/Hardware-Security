What is the first function being called when the Trusted Application is executed?
From this function, which parameters come from the normal world , and which parameters come from the secure world?

The first function be called is TA_CreateEntryPoint. This function passes through the desired trusted application to be run to the secure world so the secure world knows what application
to run. 
In short, the normal world wants to run a trusted application and passes through the ID of the function to be run as well as the parameters for the function.
In this particular case, the normal world calls the TA_CreateEntryPoint function, passing through the ID for the hello_world function and the number "42".
The hello_world function just increments a number by 1, which can be seen when the normal world gets the number 43 from the secure world.


What are the differences between running OP-TEE in simulation mode and in hardware mode?

The main difference between running OP-TEE in simulation mode and hardware mode is the speed with
which xtest runs. Because the simulation has to emulate an ARM device, it is very slow when compared to the raspberry pi, which 
runs xtest natively since the pi is an ARM device. As a result, xtest runs significantly faster on the pi than the simulation.
